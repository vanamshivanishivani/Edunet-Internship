üñêÔ∏è Gesture Volume Control
Gesture Volume Control is a computer vision project that lets you control your system's audio volume using simple hand gestures. Using a webcam, the program detects your hand in real time and calculates the distance between your thumb and index finger. This distance is then mapped to the system volume level, allowing you to increase or decrease volume by simply moving your fingers.

The project uses OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, and Pycaw to interface with the system's audio control (on Windows). It's a practical demonstration of how AI and computer vision can be applied to create touch-free, intuitive user interfaces.
